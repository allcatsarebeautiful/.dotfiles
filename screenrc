#               A 0 qualifier tells screen to treat the number as absolute position.
#               Pad relative to the last absolute pad position by adding a + qualifier or to pad relative to the right margin by using -.

# `         substitute with the output of a `backtick' command. The length qualifier is misused to identify one of the commands. See Backtick.

# The 'c' and 'C' escape may be qualified with a '0' to make screen use zero instead of space as fill character.
# The '0' qualifier also makes the '=' escape use  absolute positions.
# The 'n'  and '=' escapes understand a length qualifier (e.g. '%3n')
#     'D' and 'M' can be prefixed with 'L' to generate long names
#     'w' and 'W' also show the window flags if 'L' is given.

# An attribute/color modifier is is used to change the attributes or the color settings.
# Its format is "[attribute modifier] [color description]".
# The attribute  modifier must be prefixed by a change type indicator if it can be confused with a color description.
# The following change types are known:

#       +      add the specified set to the current attributes
#       -      remove the set from the current attributes
#       !      invert the set in the current attributes
#       =      change the current attributes to the specified set

# The attribute set is a combination of the following letters:
#       d      dim
#       u      underline
#       b      bold
#       r      reverse
#       s      standout
#       B      blinking

# Colors are two letters: background and foreground color (in that order).
#       k      black
#       r      red
#       g      green
#       y      yellow
#       b      blue
#       m      magenta
#       c      cyan
#       w      white
#       d      default color
#       .      leave color unchanged

# Capitalized letter == bright color.
# Pseudo-color 'i' sets the brightness and leaves the color unchanged.
# "%{-}" restores the attributes and colors that were set before the last change was made (i.e., pops one level of the color-change stack).

#      Examples
#       "G"    set color to bright green
#       "+b r" use bold red
#       "= yd" clear all attributes, write in default color on yellow background.
#       %-Lw%{= BW}%50>%n%f* %t%{-}%+Lw%<
#              Windows centered at current window and truncated to available width.
#              The current window is displayed white on blue.  This can be used with "hardstatus alwayslastline".
#       %?%F%{.R.}%?%3n %t%? [%h]%?
#              The window number and title and the window's hardstatus, if one is set.
#              Also use a red background if this is the active focus. Useful for "caption string".
